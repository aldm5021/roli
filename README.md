# ROLI Music Instruments: Revolutionary Expression, Unmatched Innovation, Free Worldwide Shipping

So here's the thing about ROLI – they basically took one look at the piano keyboard that's been around for centuries and said, "Yeah, we can do better." And honestly? They might be onto something.

Founded in 2009 by Roland Lamb (a jazz pianist who wanted more from his instrument), ROLI has been quietly revolutionizing how we think about keyboards. Their flagship product, the Seaboard, doesn't have traditional keys. Instead, it's got this squishy silicone surface that responds to every little movement your fingers make. Sounds weird, right? But musicians like Hans Zimmer, Stevie Wonder, and A.R. Rahman are all over it.

The company hit a rough patch in 2021 – filed for administration, the whole nine yards. But they bounced back, and in 2026, they're stronger than ever. They've even partnered with Kawai (you know, the piano company that's been around since 1927) to explore new approaches to piano learning. That's a pretty big deal.

## What Makes ROLI Different?

Most MIDI controllers are just... controllers. You press a key, it sends a signal, done. But ROLI instruments track movement in multiple dimensions – they call it "5D Touch." You can:

- **Press** (like normal velocity)
- **Slide** (left to right for pitch bends)
- **Glide** (between notes smoothly)
- **Lift** (how you release the key)
- **Strike** (initial attack)

It's basically the difference between typing an email and finger-painting. Both get the job done, but one's a lot more expressive.

## The Product Lineup

ROLI's got products for everyone – from complete beginners trying to learn "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" to professional producers crafting film scores.

### For Creators & Producers

**Seaboard 2** (49 keys)
This is the flagship. Full-size keys, aluminum chassis, comes with Equator2 software (worth $249 on its own) that has 1,400+ presets. It's got an 8-hour battery, connects via USB-C, MIDI, or Bluetooth. The current model comes in Platinum Blue or Ebony Black.

The Keywave2 surface has precision frets – kind of like guitar frets – that help you find the center of each note. People who tried the original Seaboard and found it too squishy really appreciate this update.

**Seaboard M** (24 keys)
Think of this as the Seaboard's portable little sibling. At 650g, it fits in a backpack. The keys are 25% narrower than standard piano keys (which, surprisingly, most people find more comfortable). It's got magnetic DNA connectors on both sides, so you can snap multiple units together. Want 96 keys? Connect four of them. Want a hybrid controller? Connect it to a Piano M.

Comes with ROLI Studio software, includes 200+ MPE presets. Battery lasts 10 hours. For $349.95, it's the most affordable way to get into the Seaboard ecosystem.

**Piano M for Creators** (24 keys)
This one's got traditional keys, but they light up in full RGB spectrum. Each key can bend pitch independently and has polyphonic aftertouch. The BrightKey technology shows scales, chords, and arpeggios right on the keys themselves.

Four DNA connectors mean you can build it out even more than the Seaboard M. Battery life is 6 hours. It's perfect for producers who want MPE expression but prefer traditional key feel.

### For Learners

**ROLI Piano System**
This is their newest thing – launched at NAMM 2025. It's a 49-key keyboard with an AI assistant that actually watches you play and gives feedback. The super early-bird price was $399 (regular $599), and it shipped starting April 2025.

The keys light up to show you which notes to play. The AI adjusts difficulty based on how you're doing. It's designed to solve the problem where most people quit learning piano within the first few months.

**Piano M for Learners**
Same hardware as the creator version, but paired with the ROLI Learn app (subscription required). The app has 1,000+ songs, 300+ lessons, 450+ exercises, and arcade games with 150+ levels.

Monthly subscription or annual (with savings). Solo membership or Family membership for up to 5 people. Still cheaper than traditional piano lessons.

### The Secret Weapon: Airwave

This thing is wild. It's a hand-tracking camera system that sits above your keyboard and watches your hands in 3D space. You can control sound with gestures in the air. Wave your hand for a crescendo. Flick your wrist to add layers. It works with any MIDI keyboard (after calibration), but it's designed for ROLI instruments.

For creators, it adds five more dimensions of expression. For learners, it tracks your finger positioning and technique, giving real-time feedback.

## What Real Users Say

Looking at customer reviews and forum discussions, here's what comes up:

**The Good:**
- Customer service is excellent. Multiple users specifically called it "brilliant" and "responsive"
- Build quality has improved significantly since the early days
- The feeling of playing is genuinely different – more expressive than traditional MIDI controllers
- For learning, the light-up keys actually work. Parents report their kids playing daily and progressing fast

**The Learning Curve:**
- This isn't a drop-in replacement for your MIDI keyboard
- It's genuinely like learning a new instrument
- Rapid scales and patterns take practice – those squishy keys don't forgive mistakes like traditional keys do
- Most users say it takes weeks to get comfortable, months to get good

**The Controversies:**
- Some early RISE 49 units had quality issues (though ROLI says these were specific bad production runs)
- The company's 2021 administration filing spooked some people
- Price is still a barrier for many (though the Seaboard M at $350 helps)
- Not everyone loves the squishy feel – some prefer the Osmose or Linnstrument

**For MPE Enthusiasts:**
One user who owns both a Linnstrument and an Osmose bought a Seaboard M during Black Friday 2025 and said: "I personally love the texture and the responsiveness... I love the super sleek and compact form factor." They were considering selling their Osmose because the Seaboard M fit their workflow better.

## The Software Ecosystem

ROLI's built out a pretty complete software stack:

**Equator2** - Their flagship synth. Six sound sources, 1,400+ presets, 15 effects. It's specifically designed for MPE instruments. Normally costs $249 but comes free with Seaboard 2.

**ROLI Studio** - Includes ROLI Studio Player and ROLI Studio Drums. 400+ expressive presets. Works with any DAW.

**ROLI Dashboard** - For customizing how each dimension of touch works. Essential for MPE control.

**ROLI Learn** - The AI-powered learning app (subscription required). 1,000+ songs, gamified lessons, progress tracking.

All software works with macOS and Windows. They prioritize recent OS versions and Apple Silicon, but generally support systems from the last 6-8 years.

## Who Should Buy ROLI?

**Get a Seaboard if:**
- You're a producer looking for more expressive control
- You play synthesizers or virtual instruments professionally
- You're bored with traditional MIDI controllers
- You have the patience to learn a new way of playing
- You want to emulate acoustic instrument articulations (violin vibrato, brass swells, etc.)

**Get a Piano M if:**
- You're learning piano and want something interactive
- You're a producer who travels and needs portable gear
- You want MPE expression but prefer traditional key feel
- You're buying for a kid learning music

**Get the ROLI Piano System if:**
- You're serious about learning piano (not just dabbling)
- You want AI-powered feedback and progression tracking
- You need 49 keys for two-handed playing
- You're willing to invest in a subscription for lessons

**Don't buy ROLI if:**
- You need a traditional piano feel for classical music
- You're not willing to put in practice time
- You're looking for a simple plug-and-play controller
- Budget is extremely tight (look at used markets instead)

## Compatibility

All ROLI instruments work with:
- All major DAWs (Ableton, Logic, FL Studio, Cubase, etc.)
- Standard MIDI software and hardware
- MPE-compatible synths (for full expressiveness)

Connections available:
- USB-C
- Bluetooth (4.2 on Seaboard M, 5.0 on Piano M)
- MIDI Out (via included adapters)

For learning products, you need iOS or Android tablets. iPhone X or newer for iOS, Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 or newer for Android. USB-C port required for Airwave.

## Recent Developments

**January 2026**: ROLI announced a strategic collaboration with Kawai Musical Instruments. They're integrating ROLI's piano learning software into Kawai's PiaBookPlayer app, with rollout beginning in 2026. This is huge – it brings ROLI's AI learning tech to Kawai's nearly 100 years of piano-making experience.

**Late 2024**: Released the Airwave controller, using ROLI Vision hand-tracking technology.

**Early 2025**: Launched the ROLI Piano at NAMM, with pre-orders starting January 24, 2025, and shipping in April/May 2025.

The company's trajectory since the 2021 administration is genuinely impressive. They've focused on creating more affordable entry points (Seaboard M at $350, ROLI Piano at $399-$599) while maintaining their premium flagship products.

## The Verdict

ROLI makes instruments for people who aren't satisfied with "good enough." If you're happy with your current MIDI controller, you probably don't need a Seaboard. But if you've ever been frustrated by the limitations of traditional keyboards – if you've wanted to add more humanity and expression to your digital productions – ROLI's worth looking at.

The learning curve is real. The price is higher than budget controllers. But the expressiveness is genuinely different. And in 2026, with better software, more affordable options, and improved build quality, they're in a stronger position than ever.

Whether you're a beginner who wants an interactive learning experience or a professional producer looking for new ways to express musical ideas, ROLI's got something. Just be honest with yourself about whether you're willing to put in the time to learn a new way of playing.
